Realised I might have to change the entire db to a more complex version - eurgh! DONE :D
- added storage type to database and listview

Able to delete items in the produce list with a long click: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6ta2sOUjpI

Found out that its logical to decide on storage type first before typing out the produce name so changed the UI 
so that spinner is above the edittext view.

Created a new meals class, modified dbhandler to include meals table, created a new xml file for list item layout.
meallist is not populating :( , error message fixed!
