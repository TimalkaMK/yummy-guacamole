db version 24

Realised I might have to change the entire db to a more complex version - eurgh! DONE :D
- added storage type to database and listview : Newboston tutorial 112 SQLite database

Able to delete items in the produce list with a long click: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F6ta2sOUjpI

Found out that its logical to decide on storage type first before typing out the produce name so changed the UI 
so that spinner is above the edittext view.

Created a new meals class, modified dbhandler to include meals table, created a new xml file for list item layout.
meallist is not populating :( , error message fixed!

able to populate meal list view :D
able to delete list item with a long click.

add ingredients to the list - onclick item. - * link the ingredients with the produce list eesh!* :S
used the textview of the meallist to open the ingredients list - new table in database with associate meals to
connect the meals with ingredients.

http://www.101apps.co.za/index.php/articles/passing-data-between-activities.html - pass meal name from meallistactivity
to ingredientslistactivity using intent.putextra();

list view in ingredients list is populating but saving previous meals ingredients :/ need to make sure list view 
populates with the ingredients for each meal. at the mo populating big list of ingredients from different meals :S
- added a simple where statement in query :D

Able to delete an item on the ingredients list.

Long click sorted out by setting true in get view method.

Adjusting the UI so more user friendly - unable to see what I type when entering list items so put above of list.
