Implementing a '+' button to open a pop up activity to add an item to produce list.

using kitchen activity as the criteria pop up window for each produce - removing what I have done so far i.e the 
grid view which makes things harder for user. (N)

changed the kitchen activty to popupWindow activity:
altered the size of the popup box 

connected the activity with the button in main 

created a custom theme in styles to make the background of popup translucent

*need to make the database to add to the list of produce*

created a save button in popup layout file called kitchenActivity

added an edit text view for user input

created a produce class with produce id and produce name to start off with - going add the produce storage and 
produce percentage later...

created a dbhandler class to add and print the produce list when user inputs 

remember to output the list onto the menutab layout not the popup window layout !

decided to keep the add function on the slidinglayout instead of creating a pop up

removed the popup activity and connected the dbhandler, layout file and main.java together to display produce when 
added.

now need to add the percentage and storage type 
might have to use a custom list view , spinner on percentage and storage remains 

 
 How is it going to work? gah!
 
 **auto add a product with 0% use to list when bought from shopping list 
 
 product name -> 
 
 product storage -> can be useful to categorise the shopping list 
 
 product percentage -> auto deduct when user uses for a meal
 
 colours used for storage -> colour code the list 
 
 when the percentage is 50% make amber or when 100% make red 
 
 
 Next steps:
 
 Layout -
 
 implement percentage and storage spinners 
 
 Main -
 
 connect the layout and database for percentage and storage with colours 
 
 database -
 
 implement the percentage and storage (with options)
