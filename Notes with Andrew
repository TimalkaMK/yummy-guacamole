After sprint 2:-
calendar view : icon(knife and fork) to show if you have planned a meal on that day 

top list view: change to current produce overview (fragment?)
			   colours to show how much of produce is used up 
			   

After each week or day that meals have been planned :

colours for each produce will automatically change according to the nd that the meals have been made for 
- deduce the quantity - less work for user
But if meals have not been prepared on that particular day then user can tell process to keep colour ?
could say if you haven't had a meal so that produce remains
