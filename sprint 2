Talked with Andrew about worries of getting app done, set up a meeting on thursday to show progress

android developer: fragments, creating fragments, building a dynamic UI with fragments

creating dynamic UI ,nested activities:

declared fragments in home activity layout file 
created DailyFragment class with fragment factory methods , list 
created CalendarFragment class with factory methods and callback events 

using import android.support.v4.app.FragmentActivity - in home activity 
using import import android.support.v4.app.Fragment - in fragments

realised this was not what I wanted!

derek banas: views 

Created two views in activity_home.xml file :
list view and calendar view 

Not sure if I should give them separate linear layouts.

created a customised layout and adapter for list view

remove the icons(pics) from navigation bar

Removed home activity and xml file -> home page is now content_menu_tab.xml and MenuTabActivity

Next: expandable list view and list view corresponding to date.
