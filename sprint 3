Thinking about ways to integrate the produce list into the home page ...

**each item in the kitchen produce activity will have an id so that it can go on the main page?**

created the kitchen activity page - need to make clickable to go to the produce list 
still using same custom adapter as the one for list view in homepage - might change this later

Re-thinking homepage...

Changed the list to just one item = today - need to make it drop down or expand with today's meal plan (**like guake
and a cool programming font like a secret mission?**)

another list view in homepage with produce list 

**Maybe have a designated background colour for the different storage types in homepage rather than explicitly writing
the storage type. - write this in the help secton? Produce will be coupled according to storage type **

thinking of a potential user test ...

**have a pop up after the dates on calendar has been selected to move to planning

carrot ios weather app - swipe up from bottom to reveal more data

utilise swipe up and down to show today's meals and list of kitchen produce 

make able to update the produce list and today's meals 

main page show updateable shopping list , calendar for planning 

swipe to the left to show my meals with drop down of ingredients that you can edit 

**

custom sliding drawer - newbostonvideo - deprecated :(

implemented umano android sliding up panel library -yay!

Trying to make the panel scrollable - very hard to find how to do it , was looking at umano issues on github
finally found what I needed to implement!!

now having trouble deciding how to make home-page asthetically pleasing -> calendar on homepage but need to 
decided what to do with today's meals , shopping list and meals

Ultimate goal:
Changing the list view on the homepage to accomodate the produce list - populate the list with colours and quanitities
